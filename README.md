#### Exploring Scala and Akka

purpose: This project includes a very basic demonstration of using akka streams to read, parse, and record data in a flat comma seperated values file.

StreamCsvToRepository - streams data from flat file to database

TemperatureRepository - stubbed database repo

StreamCsvToRepositorySpec - simple demonstration to test a flow
